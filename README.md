## ðŸ’¡ Project Idea
The main idea of this project is to design and implement a complete testing framework that covers both manual and automated testing for different types of applications.
The project will focus on two case studies:

1- SauceDemo (Web Application) ( https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html ):

Perform manual testing to validate core functionalities such as login, product inventory, cart, and checkout process.

Implement automation testing using tools like Selenium / Playwright / Cypress for regression testing and continuous validation of UI functionalities.

Apply different testing techniques (functional, regression, exploratory).

2- Restful Booker (API Testing) ( https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html#api-Booking-GetBookingshttps://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html ):

Perform API testing using Postman / Rest Assured to validate endpoints for booking creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.

Automate API test cases and integrate them into the testing framework.

Ensure validation of response codes, payloads, and error handling.

The project demonstrates how manual testing ensures correctness in initial phases, while automation testing improves efficiency, scalability, and reliability. It highlights industry practices for testing front-end (web) and back-end (API) systems in a real-world scenario.
